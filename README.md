## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Firebase CLI (for deployment and other Firebase-related tasks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clothing-store.git
   cd clothing-store
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. Create a Firebase project and configure your Firebase credentials. Add a `firebaseConfig.js` file in the `src` directory with your Firebase configuration:

   ```javascript
   // src/firebaseConfig.js
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };

   export default firebaseConfig;
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deployment

To deploy the application to Firebase Hosting:

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Firebase:
